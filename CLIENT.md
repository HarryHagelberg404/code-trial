One requirement when creating the application was to use **Less** as a preprocessor to **CSS**.
As I've only used SaSS before (SCSS) it's a welcome challenge to use Less instead. 
I've researched different solutions of how to integrate Less into react and its either "Ejecting" or not.

* **Less** https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-less-with-create-react-app-without-ejecting-510a3344ef5d, https://github.com/DocSpring/craco-antd/issues/4

* **JavaScript**
**React**
**Redux**
**HTML**
