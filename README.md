# Code-trial Fortnox

In this artifact I list and elaborate about the challenges, solutions the assumptions I came across when developing this application. I have divided the application into four segments to more easily separate the different programming languages, techniques and practices required when creating the application. Down below you can find the different segments.

## Setup to launch the application

## Testing the application

## Client-side

## Back-end

## Persistence

## Testing
