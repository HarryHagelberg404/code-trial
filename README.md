# Code-trial Fortnox

This artifact consist of how to start as well as how to test the application.

In the different artifacts below I list and elaborate about the challenges, solutions the assumptions I came across when developing this application. I have divided the application into three segments to more easily separate the different programming languages, techniques and practices required when creating the application. Down below you can find the different segments.

## Setup to launch the application

Open a terminal and navigate to the application root directory. Then enter **exactly**:

```
start.bat
```

## Testing the application

## Client-side

## Back-end

## Testing
