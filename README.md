# Code-trial Fortnox
In this artifact I list and elaborate about the challenges, solutions the assumptions I came across when developing this application. I have divided the application into four segments to more easily separate the different programming languages, techniques and practices required when creating the application. Down below you can find the different segments.

## Client-side
One requirement when creating the application was to use **Less** as a preprocessor to **CSS**.
As I've only used SaSS before (SCSS) it's a welcome challenge to use Less instead. 
I've researched different solutions of how to integrate Less into react and its either "Ejecting" or not.

**JavaScript**
**React**
**Redux**
**HTML**


## Back-end
**Java**

## Persistence
**MySQL**

## Testing
**Unit tests / component tests** (jUnit) and Jest or Mocha together with Enzyme and any assertion library for testing react components.
* High coverage.
* Clean easy to read tests.

* **Less** https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-less-with-create-react-app-without-ejecting-510a3344ef5d, https://github.com/DocSpring/craco-antd/issues/4
