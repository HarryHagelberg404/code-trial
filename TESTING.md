# Testing

#### JUnit

**Unit tests / component tests** (jUnit) and Jest or Mocha together with Enzyme and any assertion library for testing react components.

- High coverage.
- Clean easy to read tests.

I decided to not construct any tests for the listController class as all it does is recieve a GET request and then makes other method calls.
A better solution is to make test using Postman and test the methods in question separetely.

the addController was tested upon the boolean value returned from the DBManager class.

#### Mocha

#### Enzyme
